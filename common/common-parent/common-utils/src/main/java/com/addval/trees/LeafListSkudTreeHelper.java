/**
 * This class demonstrates an approach that can be used when an application
 * needs to be able to store and retrieve multiple appplicationDataObjects
 * under the same SkudTree keys[].
 *
 * See SimpleSkudTreeHelper for an implementation of the approach where,
 * instead of being "added" to a SkudTreeLeafNode, application objects
 * are subject to simple replacement.  I.e., if two different application
 * objects are passed to putLeafNode with the same keys[], the first one
 * inserted will be replaced when the second one is inserted.
