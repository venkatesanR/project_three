 * Each plant must contain less or equal amount of pesticide than the plant to
 * it's left in order to survive. Maintain a stack where every element on the
 * stack contains the following information about a plant: the amount of
 * pesticide contained in the plant the number of days that have passed.
 * Initially, push onto the stack, where is the amount of pesticide contained in
 * the -th plant. Then iterate over the plants from left to right. Suppose that
 * the -th plant is now being considered. If the stack isn't empty, pop the top
 * element from the stack and compare it with . If is greater than this value,
 * then the -th plant will die on the first day. So add to the stack. Otherwise,
 * pop as long as the value in the top of the stack is greater than or equal to
 * . Update the answer with the second integer of the pair pushed onto the
 * stack. If the stack becomes empty then add to the stack otherwise add .
