 * Primary Members of an adapter pattern describes below Client Target Adapter
 * Adaptee
 * 
 * Consider the scenario You are writing some Application Based on Third party
 * API's today you are writing API for Adaptee(i) You have done all
 * implementation based on client 1 tomorrow Client 2 you want to integrate then
 * you should have to re write all code and also it's unmaintable.To Clarify
 * this Make One Common object That will underStand your system and create an
 * adapter to infront of your common code transform all client code with common
 * object and transfrom it..so that you dont have to re wright your code.
